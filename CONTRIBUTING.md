   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Follow the coding standards and run tests:
   ```
   cargo fmt
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo test
   ```
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

#### Pull Request Guidelines

* Update documentation for significant changes
* Add tests for new functionality
* Maintain the existing code style
* Keep pull requests focused on a single concern
* Link related issues in the pull request description
* Be prepared to address feedback and make changes if requested

## RFC Process

For significant changes that require broader discussion, we use a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

1. Check the [rfc directory](/rfc) for existing RFCs related to your proposal
2. Create a new markdown file in the RFC directory following the naming convention: `rfc-XX-your-proposal-name.md`
3. Use the template format from existing RFCs
4. Submit a PR with your RFC
5. The RFC will be discussed with the community and core team
6. Once approved, the implementation can begin

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

* Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
* Comment complex logic or non-obvious decisions
* Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before committing

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
* Include integration tests for API changes
* Test browser compatibility for frontend changes

### Documentation

* Update API documentation for public interfaces
* Add JSDoc or equivalent comments for JavaScript/TypeScript
* Update README and other docs for user-facing changes
* Document new features with examples
