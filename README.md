## Overview

videocall.rs is a modern, open-source video conferencing system written entirely in Rust, designed for developers who need reliable, scalable, and secure real-time communication capabilities. It provides a foundation for building custom video communication solutions, with support for both browser-based and native clients.

**Project Status:** Beta - Actively developed and suitable for non-critical production use

## Features

- **High Performance:** Built with Rust for optimal resource utilization and low latency
- **Multiple Transport Protocols:** Support for WebSockets and WebTransport 
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Optional secure communications between peers
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with a pub/sub model using NATS for horizontal scaling
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) with Safari support in development. Firefox is not supported due to incomplete MediaStreamTrackProcessor implementation.
- **Native Client Support:** CLI tool for headless video streaming from devices like Raspberry Pi
- **Open Source:** MIT licensed for maximum flexibility

## Why WebTransport Instead of WebRTC?

WebTransport is a core technology that differentiates videocall.rs from traditional video conferencing solutions. As a developer, here's why our WebTransport approach is technically superior:

### Technical Advantages

- **No SFUs, No NAT Traversal:** WebTransport eliminates the need for complex Selective Forwarding Units and NAT traversal mechanisms that plague WebRTC implementations and cause countless developer headaches.

- **Simplified Architecture**: No more complex STUN/TURN servers, ICE candidates negotiation, or complicated signaling dances required by WebRTC. Just direct, straightforward connections.

- **Protocol Efficiency**: Built on HTTP/3 and QUIC, WebTransport provides multiplexed, bidirectional streams with better congestion control and packet loss recovery than WebRTC's dated SCTP data channels.

- **Lower Latency**: QUIC's 0-RTT connection establishment reduces initial connection times compared to WebRTC's multiple roundtrips.

- **Clean Development Experience**: WebTransport offers a more intuitive developer API with a promise-based design and cleaner stream management.

- **Future-Proof**: As part of the modern web platform developed by the IETF and W3C, WebTransport has strong browser vendor support and an actively evolving specification.

### Developer Implications

For developers integrating videocall.rs, this means:
- ✅ Drastically simpler deployment architecture
- ✅ No complex network configuration or firewall issues
- ✅ Better performance in challenging network conditions
- ✅ More predictable behavior across implementations
- ✅ Less time spent debugging connectivity issues
- ✅ A forward-looking technology investment

Read our [Architecture Document](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a deep dive into how we implement WebTransport and the technical benefits it provides.

## System Architecture

videocall.rs follows a microservices architecture with these primary components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Clients[Clients<br>Browsers, Mobile, CLI] -->|WebSocket| ActixAPI[Actix API<br>WebSocket]
    Clients -->|WebTransport| WebTransportServer[WebTransport<br>Server]
    ActixAPI --> NATS[NATS<br>Messaging]
    WebTransportServer --> NATS
```

1. **actix-api:** Rust-based backend server using Actix Web framework
2. **yew-ui:** Web frontend built with the Yew framework and compiled to WebAssembly
3. **videocall-types:** Shared data types and protocol definitions
4. **videocall-client:** Client library for native integration
5. **videocall-cli:** Command-line interface for headless video streaming


For a more detailed explanation of the system architecture, please see our [Architecture Document](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Getting Started

**⭐ RECOMMENDED: Docker is the only fully supported development method ⭐**

We strongly recommend using the Docker-based setup for development, as it's well-maintained and provides consistent behavior across platforms. The manual setup described below is not as well maintained and may require additional troubleshooting.

### Prerequisites

- Modern Linux distribution, macOS, or Windows 10/11
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) 1.85+ (for manual setup)
- Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) for frontend access - Firefox is not supported

### Docker Setup

The quickest way to get started is with our Docker-based setup:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/security-union/videocall-rs.git
   cd videocall-rs
   ```

2. Start the server (replace `<server-ip>` with your machine's IP address):
   ```
   make up
   ```

3. Open Chrome using the provided script for local WebTransport:
   ```
   ./launch_chrome.sh
   ```

4. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://<server-ip>/meeting/<username>/<meeting-id>
   ```

### Manual Setup (Experimental)

⚠️ **Warning**: This setup method is experimental and not as well maintained as the Docker approach. You may encounter issues that require manual debugging.

For advanced users who prefer to run services directly on their machine:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database:
   ```
   createdb actix-api-db
   ```

2. Install required tools:
   ```
   # Install NATS server
   curl -L https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases/download/v2.9.8/nats-server-v2.9.8-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
   sudo mv nats-server-v2.9.8-linux-amd64/nats-server /usr/local/bin
   
   # Install trurl
   cargo install trurl
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```
   ./start_dev.sh
   ```

4. Connect to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081/meeting/<username>/<meeting-id>
   ```

For detailed configuration options, see our [setup documentation](https://docs.videocall.rs/setup).

## Usage

### Browser-Based Clients

1. Navigate to your deployed instance or localhost setup:
   ```
   http://<server-address>/meeting/<username>/<meeting-id>
   ```

2. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted

3. Click "Connect" to join the meeting

### CLI-Based Streaming

For headless devices like Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
cargo install videocall-cli

# Stream from a camera
videocall-cli stream \
  --user-id <your-user-id> \
  --video-device-index 0 \
  --meeting-id <meeting-id> \
  --resolution 1280x720 \
  --fps 30 \
  --frame-format NV12 \
  --bitrate-kbps 500
```

For detailed information about the CLI tool and all available options, see the [videocall-cli README](videocall-cli/README.md).

### Git Hooks

This repository includes Git hooks to ensure code quality:

1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Automatically runs `cargo fmt` before each commit to ensure consistent code formatting.
2. **Post-commit Hook**: Runs `cargo clippy` after each commit to check for potential code improvements.

To install these hooks, run the following commands from the project root:

```bash
# Create the hooks directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .git/hooks

# Create the pre-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh

# Run cargo fmt and check if there are changes
echo "Running cargo fmt..."
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Check the exit code of cargo fmt
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "cargo fmt found formatting issues. Please fix them before committing."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
EOF

# Create the post-commit hook
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/sh

# Run cargo clippy after the commit
echo "Running cargo clippy..."
ACTIX_UI_BACKEND_URL="" WEBTRANSPORT_HOST="" LOGIN_URL="" WEBTRANSPORT_URL="" ACTIX_API_URL="" cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Check the exit code of cargo clippy
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Cargo clippy found issues in your code. Please fix them."
    # We can't abort the commit since it's already done, but we can inform the user
    echo "The commit was successful, but please consider fixing the clippy issues before pushing."
fi

exit 0
EOF

# Make the hooks executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
```

These hooks help maintain code quality by ensuring proper formatting and checking for common issues.
