## <span style="color:orange;">5 Causes of Psychiatric Illness</span>

1. **<span style="color:orange;">Existence of Society</span>**  
   Society provides the framework against which behavior is judged, allowing us to label actions as normal or abnormal. Without a community to compare against, it becomes challenging to define deviations.

2. **<span style="color:orange;">Existence of Culture</span>**  
   Culture, with its own set of rules and traditions, shapes our understanding of mental health and acceptable behavior. Deviations from these norms can lead to an increase in psychiatric diagnoses.

3. **<span style="color:orange;">Mathematical Concept of "Normality"</span>**  
   Normality is inherently statistical, requiring a baseline to identify deviations as abnormal. This concept underpins how psychiatric disorders are classified as variations from societal norms.

4. **<span style="color:orange;">Existence of an Educational System</span>**  
   Structured academic environments often uncover conditions like ADHD through systematic evaluation. In settings without formal testing, such conditions might not be recognized at all.

5. **<span style="color:orange;">Presence of High-Level Intelligence and Cognition</span>**  
   Advanced cognitive abilities can sometimes be accompanied by psychological challenges, with schizophrenia being an extreme example. This may be seen as a genetic side effect of heightened intelligence and creativity.
