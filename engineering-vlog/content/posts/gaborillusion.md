###  <span style="color:orange;"> New Gabor Illusion </span>

While diving into some hands-on coding with [Gabor patches](https://altunenes.github.io/posts/2023/10/gabor/), a fascinating idea struck me: What if I sculpted shapes like triangles or ellipses, infused them with some sine phases, and voila—could I possibly evoke a simple reverse phi effect? 🤔🔄

To my delight, I believe I succeeded! 🎉 Navigate your cursor and hit the space bar to unveil the effect. 🖱️⌨️ Your insights and thoughts are eagerly awaited! =)

or look at that =) not: unlike other "reverse phi motion" effects, this one doesn't have "thin edges" with sine phases. Its just Gabors... 😁
