## The Why Behind Late-Night Coding

**⚠️ Disclaimer: This isn't sustainable. Use sparingly for critical issues only.**

Research shows that people actually perform better on creative problem-solving tasks during their non-optimal times of day - when they're slightly tired and less inhibited<sup>[2]</sup>. This reduced frontal lobe activity allows for more creative connections between ideas, making those 2 AM coding sessions surprisingly effective for breakthrough moments.

I am the creator of the [videocall](https://videocall.rs) project by night, but I'm also a staff engineer at May Mobility. If your autonomous vehicle trip has any sort of latency or interruption during the ride—that's on me.

I take this responsibility seriously, and sometimes my brain wakes me up in the middle of the night to get that one last thing done.

This article will be a guide on how to get the most out of your 2 AM coding session.

**Here's what we'll cover:**
1. Setting clear, achievable goals
2. Time boundaries (crucial for your health)
3. Environment optimization 
4. Using the Pomodoro Technique
5. Real-world debugging example
6. Recovery strategies
7. Why this actually works (with science)

## 1. Define Your Goal

Realistically, you only have a few hours to work, so you need to define your goal. Be realistic, don't set yourself up for failure.

You are already working late, so it better be worth it.

## 2. Define When You're Going to Bed

So if you start at 2 AM, you should plan to go to bed at 3:30 AM tops. You need to sleep.

## 3. Get Your Environment Ready

- Turn off notifications: both browser and phone: **nothing destroys focus like a Discord notification.**
- Close all other tabs.
- Turn on the lights, you'll be surprised how much better you can see.
- Contrary to the popular belief, you don't need to be in a dark room to code. In fact, you'll be surprised how much better you can see with the lights on.
- Set your perfect playlist. Use a dbmeter to get the perfect volume. I recommend 50dB - 60dB, though you'll probably find yourself adjusting the volume throughout the session.
- Here's my playlist if you want to use it: [Deep Focus: 2 AM](https://music.youtube.com/browse/VLPLxM2CWwQlzBtfIgvgv2lwqhNlJBPD0eLI)


## 4. Use a Pomodoro Timer

Utilize a pomodoro timer, this will help you stay focused and on track.

Here's a pomodoro timer I use: [Pomodoro Timer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pomodoro-chrome-extension/iccjkhpkdhdhjiaocipcegfeoclioejn?hl=en&pli=1) also [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/) is a great option.

## 5. Divide Into Focused Chunks (The Real Work Begins)

Between 2 AM and 3:30 AM, you have 90 minutes. Here's how I'd break down a real scenario:

**The Problem:** ETA service is returning 504s for 3% of requests, but only during peak hours. Users are seeing "Trip delayed" notifications when their ride is actually 2 minutes away.

**Chunk 1 (2:00-2:25): Reproduce the issue**
- Set up load testing to simulate peak traffic
- Check if it's database connection pooling or downstream service timeout
- One laser focus: "Can I reproduce this locally?"

**5-minute break: Step away from screen**
- Don't scroll social media - your brain needs to process
- Get water, look out window, let the subconscious work

**Chunk 2 (2:30-2:55): Root cause analysis**  
- Now that I can reproduce it, dive into logs
- Is it the rate limiter? Database query timeout? Network partition?
- One laser focus: "What's the actual bottleneck?"

**5-minute break: Step away from screen**
- Go to the bathroom, get water, move around.

**Chunk 3 (3:00-3:25): Minimum viable fix**
- Not the perfect solution - that's for tomorrow
- Circuit breaker pattern? Increase timeout? Graceful degradation?
- One laser focus: "What's the safest change that fixes this tonight?"

## ⚠️ STOP! Save Your Work!!

I cannot stress this enough. **Stop! Commit your work!!** I cannot tell you how many times, due to the fact that it's 3:30 AM and you're trying to get it done, you forget to save your work and you lose it all! Don't be like Homer Simpson realizing he forgot to save his work - that's a big "D'oh!" moment you don't want to experience at 3:30 AM.

**Write a descriptive commit message** because tomorrow you'll forget the details and you'll have to re-read the code to understand your 3 AM logic.

## ✅ Get a Good Night's Sleep

You need to sleep.

## 6. Recovery and Balance

**The next day is crucial for your health:**
- Sleep in if possible - your body needs to recover
- Avoid caffeine late in the day to reset your sleep cycle  
- Don't make this a habit - your immune system, relationships, and long-term performance will suffer
- Use this technique sparingly: emergencies, critical deadlines, or when you're genuinely inspired at night

## 7. Why I Keep Doing This (Despite Knowing Better)

Throughout my career, I've had many of my major breakthroughs at 2 AM, and I'm not alone. Like Bleeding Gums Murphy finding his best jazz on that Springfield bridge at 2 AM, there's something magical about the late-night hours that unlocks creativity you just can't access during the day.

**Some of my biggest wins:**
- Solved a distributed systems race condition that had stumped our team for weeks
- Architected the core algorithm for videocall.rs during a 3 AM inspiration session
- Fixed a critical production bug that was costing us thousands per hour

The combination of reduced inhibition, fewer distractions, and that quiet "flow state" creates perfect conditions for breakthrough thinking. But remember - this is a tool, not a lifestyle.

## The Bottom Line

Late-night coding can be incredibly productive when done right, but it should be the exception, not the rule. When you do find yourself coding at 2 AM, make it count: define your goal, set a time limit, eliminate distractions, and work in focused chunks.

Your future self will thank you for both the breakthrough solution and the commit message explaining what the hell you were thinking at 3:30 AM.
