Ever stumbled upon something so interesting that you just couldn't let it go? That's what happened to me with optical illusions. My first exposure to optical illusions was in my undergraduate intro textbooks, and that was the point from which I was captured. So, whenever I see a new illusion, mostly on Twitter, my day is ruined because my brain just won't let it go until I try to reproduce it with coding and understand the mechanism at a low level.

Four years (2018-2022) ago my coding skills were. well, let's say, they were just born. But the challenge to create these optical illusions was very tempting. I wanted to dig deeper into this, so as to control the illusion. I saw how with just small changes in the code, it became stronger or disappeared.

It had been a very steep learning curve, but every line of code was a step closer to finally unraveling the mysteries of human vision. After so much coding and debugging, I finally reached a repository using which you can display and manipulate almost all famous optical illusions with just a few lines of code [**<font color="red">sorceress</font>**](https://github.com/altunenes/sorceress). And for those curious minds, I've also documented the science and explanations behind each illusion. Not only illusions explained, but you can also find the API documentation for humans, of course [**<font color="red">here</font>**](https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/explanations%20of%20illusions/).

Sometimes I look at my old code and cringe a little, but then I smileâ€”it shows me only how far I came. From a total beginner to this comprehensive repo on Optical Illusions, the journey has been quite something. I don't really contribute to this repository since I mostly write my code in Rust. So if you are in search of more dynamic, solid, and the latest illusions, check my other repository

But why in the world, you may ask, why all this effort? Well, to be totally honest, I really don't know.

This is actually a question that I always come across, especially on interviews that I mostly bomb. But the answer probably lies in the complexity of human vision. I believe most of the understanding of vision from us is based on implicit assumptions. Optical illusions challenge these assumptions more like little experiments and with an irresistibly captivating factor about them: seeing how easily our vision can be played with. And let's not forget the human curiosity factor. Perhaps one of the questions for research could be the fascination of optical illusions and, in fact, lifelong attempts to understand them. Yes, I do realize that up to now I haven't had any concrete answer to the question. I tried to play tricks with your brain through the illusion to let you think I have a concrete answer. I am sorry for that.
