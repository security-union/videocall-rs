From my inner perspective, art is a way to satisfy the inherent urge to experiment. I eventually discovered that engaging in art means simply “experimenting”—testing a hypothesis: "Will this color evoke satisfaction?", "Can this formula generate a more intriguing pattern?", "Might this technique better express the idea that enlivens my mind?"

As a shader programmer, I work within a fully experimental process. Every line of code is an experiment. If you enjoy the thrill of experimentation, you likely share a passion for the intersection of art and math.

Ultimately, each of these questions represents an experiment with no room for deceit, as you are the only impartial judge. In this way, the reliability of your creative process can even surpass conventional scientific knowledge.

At a deeper level, what we often call "aesthetic" in art—seemingly subjective and random—reveals an essence that closely mirrors scientific inquiry. Whether it’s the dawn of art or the invention of the wheel, the underlying purpose is the same: to experience that indescribable satisfaction of making an experiment.
