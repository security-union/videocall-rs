# Rust NetEQ — Adaptive Jitter Buffer for Real-Time Audio

Part of the **[videocall.rs](https://github.com/security-union/videocall-rs)** real-time communication stack.

> **Project status:** early preview – API is settling, performance tuning in progress.

Rust NetEQ is a pure-Rust, libWebRTC-inspired jitter buffer designed for professional, low-latency audio applications. It smooths out bursty networks, conceals packet loss, and keeps playback on time so that downstream DSP or audio renderers can focus on sound, not sockets.

## Why Rust NetEQ?

* **Latency you control** – adaptive target delay with hard minimum/maximum bounds.
* **Rock-solid ordering** – duplicate detection, re-sequencing, and smart flushing protect against wild packet arrival patterns.
* **Seamless playout** – accelerate, pre-emptive expand, and classical expand algorithms reduce audible artifacts without introducing heavy CPU cost.
* **Actionable metrics** – detailed runtime statistics make debugging network conditions trivial.
* **Zero unsafe ✨** – implemented in 100 % safe Rust; integrates into `no_std` builds that provide an allocator.

## At a Glance

```toml
[dependencies]
neteq = "0.1"
```

Insert RTP payloads as they arrive, call `get_audio()` every 10 ms, and let the buffer handle the rest.  Full runnable snippets live in the [examples](examples) directory — open `basic_usage.rs` first.

```

Each 10 ms tick NetEQ decides between **Normal**, **Accelerate**, **Pre-emptive Expand**, or **Expand** based on buffer fullness and arrival trends.  Decisions and their rationale are exposed through the statistics API for post-analysis.

## Examples

| Example              | Highlights                                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `basic_usage.rs`     | Minimal integration loop                                |
| `neteq_player.rs`    | WAV replay with user-defined jitter & re-ordering knobs |

Run any example with

```bash
cargo run --release --example basic_usage
```
