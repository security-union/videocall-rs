# Rust NetEQ — Adaptive Jitter Buffer for Real-Time Audio

Part of the **[videocall.rs](https://github.com/security-union/videocall-rs)** real-time communication stack.

> **Project status:** early preview – API is settling, performance tuning in progress.

Rust NetEQ is a pure-Rust, libWebRTC-inspired jitter buffer designed for professional, low-latency audio applications. It smooths out bursty networks, conceals packet loss, and keeps playback on time so that downstream DSP or audio renderers can focus on sound, not sockets.

## Why Rust NetEQ?

* **Latency you control** – adaptive target delay with hard minimum/maximum bounds.
* **Rock-solid ordering** – duplicate detection, re-sequencing, and smart flushing protect against wild packet arrival patterns.
* **Seamless playout** – accelerate, pre-emptive expand, and classical expand algorithms reduce audible artifacts without introducing heavy CPU cost.
* **Actionable metrics** – detailed runtime statistics make debugging network conditions trivial.
* **Zero unsafe ✨** – implemented in 100 % safe Rust; integrates into `no_std` builds that provide an allocator.

## At a Glance

### Native Rust Applications

```toml
[dependencies]
neteq = "0.1"
```

Insert RTP payloads as they arrive, call `get_audio()` every 10 ms, and let the buffer handle the rest.  Full runnable snippets live in the [examples](examples) directory — open `basic_usage.rs` first.

### Web Applications (WASM + WebWorker)

```toml
[dependencies]
neteq = { version = "0.1", features = ["web"], default-features = false }
```

For browser environments, NetEq ships with:
- **🕸️ WebWorker binary** (`neteq_worker`) for off-main-thread audio processing
- **🎵 Embedded Opus decoder** - no external dependencies to serve
- **🌐 Cross-browser support** - unified decoder works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **⚡ WASM integration** - `WebNetEq` wrapper with JavaScript bindings

```javascript
// Main thread: spawn NetEq worker
const worker = new Worker('/neteq_worker.js');

// Send Opus packets to worker
worker.postMessage({
  cmd: 'insert',
  seq: sequenceNumber,
  timestamp: rtpTimestamp,
  payload: opusPacketBytes
});

// Receive decoded PCM frames
worker.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.data instanceof Float32Array) {
    // 10ms of decoded audio ready for playback
    audioWorklet.port.postMessage(event.data);
  }
};
```

Each 10 ms tick NetEQ decides between **Normal**, **Accelerate**, **Pre-emptive Expand**, or **Expand** based on buffer fullness and arrival trends.  Decisions and their rationale are exposed through the statistics API for post-analysis.

## 🌐 Web Deployment & Embedded Opus Decoder

NetEq includes a complete web deployment solution with **zero external dependencies**:

### WebWorker Architecture
- **`neteq_worker`** binary runs NetEq off the main thread
- Receives Opus packets via `postMessage()`
- Returns decoded PCM frames as `Float32Array`
- Built-in mute/unmute and diagnostics controls

### Self-Contained Opus Decoding
- **Embedded `opus-decoder.min.js`** - compiled at build time, no CDN required
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Automatic fallback** - graceful degradation on unsupported browsers
- **Zero configuration** - decoder loads automatically in worker context

### Build Integration
When you build with `--features web`, the Opus decoder JavaScript is embedded directly into the WASM binary using `include_str!()`. This means:

- ✅ No external files to serve alongside your application
- ✅ No version mismatches between NetEq and Opus decoder
- ✅ Works in any deployment environment (CDN, static hosting, etc.)
- ✅ Offline-capable applications

```bash
# Build NetEq worker for web deployment
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --bin neteq_worker --features web --no-default-features
```

## Examples

### Native Examples

| Example              | Highlights                                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `basic_usage.rs`     | Minimal integration loop                                |
| `neteq_player.rs`    | WAV replay with user-defined jitter & re-ordering knobs |

```bash
cargo run --release --example basic_usage
```
