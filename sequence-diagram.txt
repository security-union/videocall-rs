Alice->Server:Alice joins room 1
Alice->Server:Alice starts sending encrypted heartbeats
Alice->Server:Alice sends RSA pub key message

Bob->Server:Bob joins room 1
Bob->Server:Bob starts sending encrypted heartbeats
Bob->Server:Bob sends RSA pub key message

Server->Alice:Server sends Bob's RSA pub key message to Alice
Alice-->Server:Responding to Bob's RSA pub key msg, Alice encrypts their AES key with Bob's RSA pub key and sends it to the server
Server-->Bob:Bob receives the AES msg from Alice and decrypts it with Bob's RSA private key

Alice->Server:Alice notices that Bob is a new peer and sends the RSA pub key message again
Server->Bob:Server sends Alice's RSA pub key message to Bob
Bob-->Server:Responding to Alices's RSA pub key msg, Bob encrypts their AES key with Alice's RSA pub key and sends it to the server
Server-->Alice:Alice receives the AES msg from Bob and decrypts it with Alice's RSA private key

Casey->Server:Casey joins room 1
Casey->Server:Casey starts sending encrypted heartbeats
Casey->Server:Casey sends RSA pub key message

Server->Alice:Server sends Casey's RSA pub key message to Alice
