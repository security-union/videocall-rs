# nokhwa-bindings-linux
This crate is the V4L2 bindings for the `nokhwa` crate.

It is not meant for general consumption. If you are looking for a Linux camera capture crate, consider using `nokhwa` with feature `input-native`.

No support or API stability will be given. Subject to change at any time.
