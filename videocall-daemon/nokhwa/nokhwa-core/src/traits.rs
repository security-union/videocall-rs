/// This trait is for any backend that allows you to grab and take frames from a camera.

/// **Note**:
/// - Backends, if not provided with a camera format, will be spawned with 640x480@15 FPS, MJPEG [`CameraFormat`].
/// - Behaviour can differ from backend to backend. While the Camera struct abstracts most of this away, if you plan to use the raw backend structs please read the `Quirks` section of each backend.
/// - If you call [`stop_stream()`](CaptureBackendTrait::stop_stream()), you will usually need to call [`open_stream()`](CaptureBackendTrait::open_stream()) to get more frames from the camera.
