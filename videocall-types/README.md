`videocall-types` is a Rust library that provides the shared types and definitions for the [videocall.rs](https://videocall.rs) teleconferencing system. This crate contains essential data structures and type definitions used across the system, enabling seamless communication and interoperability between components.

## Main Repo

If you are new to videocall you should start at our repo [videocall](https://github.com/security-union/videocall-rs)

## Features

- **Common Data Models**: Standardized types for messages, user sessions, room configurations, and more.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Implementations for  Protobuf to enable efficient data transfer (well better than JSON).
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed structures to reduce errors in communication.

Then, import and use the types in your project:

```rust
use videocall_types::protos::{
    connection_packet::ConnectionPacket,
    packet_wrapper::{packet_wrapper::PacketType, PacketWrapper},
};
```
